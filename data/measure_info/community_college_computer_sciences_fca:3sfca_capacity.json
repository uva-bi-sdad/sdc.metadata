    "long_description": "Community college computer science program access score based on 3-step floating catchment areas. This method is an aggregation of programs per population ratios weighted by distance or travel time in each catchment area (area within which a program is accessible). Weights are defined for the demand for programs (adult population) and the supply is the capacity of programs (number of seats).",
